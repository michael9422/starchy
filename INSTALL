INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
====================

Download the source tarball or git repository to someplace convenient,
like "/usr/local/src/". If downloading the tarball, unzip and un-tar the
package. Change into the new directory, 

	# cd starchy-x.x.x

Then, from the command prompt, do (as root)

	# ./configure
	# make
	# make install

For instructions on using the library functions, see the example program
"starchy_search.c".

Included with the source code are some sample indexed data files for use
with the library search routines. These data files are for a ~5 to 7 degree
field of view, so the angular separation for star triplets is from 1 to 4
degrees.

To build the indexed data files for a smaller fields of view, run

	# ./starchy_create <faint> <sep_min> <sep_max> <member> <int_min>
 
where the parameters are

	faint     - faint limit (V magnitude)
	sep_min   - minimum star spacing for triplets (degrees)
	sep_max   - maximum star spacing for triplets (degrees)
	member    - maximum number of triplets for any star to be a member of
	int_min   - interior angle minimum (degrees)

The default values, which are used for the included data files, are

	# ./starchy_create 8.0 1.0 4.0 12 20.0

For a smaller, 0.91 degree, field of view I used these parameters

	# ./starchy_create 11.0 0.15 0.5 15 20.0


To build new indexed data files the Tycho-2 catalog must be installed. The
default path names for it are

	/usr/local/data/tycho/CD/data/index.dat
	/usr/local/data/tycho/CD/data/catalog.dat

The Tycho-2 files sizes are 

	528301904 catalog.dat
	   419672 index.dat
